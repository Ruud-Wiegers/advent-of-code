# Advent of Code
Solutions for [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/), written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) 1.3.

The coding style is firmly 'recreational': more attention has been paid to conciseness than to legibility. 
I use a wrapper class to fetch inputs from the site, and to pretty-print the results. 
Other than that, the solutions are written mostly as self-contained files.
